        <h1 class="content-title">Breast Cancer in Men</h1>
        <p class="content-text">Breast cancer is often thought of as a condition that only affects women, but men can also develop it.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">It's much less common in men than women. The cancer develops in the small amount of breast tissue men have behind their nipples. The most common symptom is a hard, painless lump in one of the breasts.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">However, the vast majority of breast lumps are caused by a condition called gynaecomastia. This is a common non-cancerous condition where male breast tissue becomes enlarged.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">Breast cancer in men can also cause nipple problems, such as the nipple turning in on itself (retraction) or nipple discharge.</p>
        
        <h2 class="content-subtitle">When to speak to your GP</h2>
        <p class="content-text">You should always talk to your GP if you notice a lump in your breast or you have problems affecting your nipples, such as discharge.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">While these symptoms are unlikely to be caused by breast cancer, they should be investigated further.</p>
        
        <h2 class="content-subtitle">Why it happens</h2>
        <p class="content-text">The cause of male breast cancer is unclear, but factors known to increase your chances of developing the condition include:</p>
        
        <ul class="content-list">
          <li>Age – most cases affect men over the age of 60</li>
          <li>Having a family history of breast cancer (male or female)</li>
          <li>Obesity – a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="content-subtitle">Outlook</h2>
        <p class="content-text">The outlook for breast cancer is not as good in men as in women. This is because there's reduced awareness of the condition and it may take longer to diagnose.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">The survival rates for breast cancer in men largely depend on how far the cancer has spread before it's diagnosed.</p>
        
        <div class="info-box">
          <p><strong>Important:</strong> Breast cancer diagnosed at an early stage can often be treated successfully, but effective treatment is more difficult if the cancer has spread beyond the breast tissue.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div id="symptoms-of-breast-cancer-in-men" class="content-section">
        <h1 class="content-title">Symptoms of Breast Cancer in Men</h1>
        <p class="content-text">The main symptom of breast cancer in men is a hard lump in one of your breasts. The lump is almost always painless.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">The lump is usually located underneath the nipple and areola (the circle of dark-colored skin surrounding the nipple).</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">However, the vast majority of breast lumps are caused by a condition called gynaecomastia. This is a common non-cancerous condition where male breast tissue becomes enlarged.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">Less common symptoms of male breast cancer include:</p>
        
        <ul class="content-list">
          <li>The nipple beginning to turn in on itself (nipple retraction)</li>
          <li>The nipple becoming hard and inflamed, and looking sore (nipple ulceration)</li>
          <li>Fluid leaking from the nipple (nipple discharge)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="content-subtitle">Advanced symptoms</h2>
        <p class="content-text">Additional symptoms usually only develop if the cancer spreads from the breast to other parts of the body, such as the bones, liver or lungs. This is known as metastatic breast cancer.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">Symptoms of metastatic breast cancer include:</p>
        
        <ul class="content-list">
          <li>Bone pain</li>
          <li>Swelling of the lymph nodes (glands), usually in or around the armpit</li>
          <li>Shortness of breath</li>
          <li>Feeling unusually tired all the time</li>
          <li>Feeling sick (nausea)</li>
          <li>Itchy skin with yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="warning-box">
          <p><strong>When to seek medical advice:</strong> You should always visit your GP if you notice a lump in your breast or you have problems affecting your nipples, such as retraction, ulceration or discharge.</p>

      <div id="causes-of-breast-cancer-in-men" class="content-section">
        <h1 class="content-title">Causes of Breast Cancer in Men</h1>
        <p class="content-text">It's not clear exactly what causes breast cancer in men, although a number of things can increase your risk of developing the condition.</p>
        
        <h2 class="content-subtitle">Age</h2>
        <p class="content-text">Like many cancers, men have an increased risk of developing breast cancer as they get older. Most cases are diagnosed in men aged 60 to 70. It's rare for young men to develop the condition.</p>
        
        <h2 class="content-subtitle">Genetics and family history</h2>
        <p class="content-text">A genetic mutation is a permanent alteration in the DNA sequence that makes up a gene. The result is that one or more of the body's processes may not work in the way they should.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">There are a number of genetic mutations known to increase your risk of developing breast cancer. The most significant mutation identified is known as the BRCA2 mutation.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">There's also evidence that breast cancer can run in families, especially in men who have a first-degree relative who has developed breast cancer, such as a mother or sister.</p>
        
        <h2 class="content-subtitle">Oestrogen</h2>
        <p class="content-text">There's evidence that high levels of the hormone oestrogen, or prolonged exposure to it, can increase the risk of breast cancer in men.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">Compared with women, men tend to have low levels of oestrogen, but there are circumstances that can increase the levels of oestrogen in men. These include:</p>
        
        <ul class="content-list">
          <li>Hormone treatments – man-made (synthetic) versions of oestrogen are often used to treat prostate cancer</li>
          <li>Obesity – obese men have higher levels of oestrogen than normal</li>
          <li>Cirrhosis – this is scarring of the liver, often caused by long-term alcohol misuse</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="content-subtitle">Radiation</h2>
        <p class="content-text">Exposure to radiation has been linked to an increased risk of developing breast cancer in men.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">Research has found men who received a course of radiotherapy directed at the upper chest were seven times more likely to develop male breast cancer compared with the population at large.</p>
        
        <div class="danger-box">
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> Even a seven-fold increase means the chance of developing breast cancer is still very low.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div id="diagnosing-breast-cancer-in-men" class="content-section">
        <h1 class="content-title">Diagnosing Breast Cancer in Men</h1>
        <p class="content-text">If you have symptoms of breast cancer, such as a hard, painless lump in one of your breasts, your GP will carefully examine you.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">During the examination, they'll also look for other possible signs of male breast cancer, such as swollen lymph nodes (glands).</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">It's likely your GP will refer you for further tests if there's a possibility you may have breast cancer.</p>
        
        <h2 class="content-subtitle">Mammogram</h2>
        <p class="content-text">A mammogram is a type of X-ray used to help determine whether there are any changes in breast tissue that could be the result of cancer.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">During the mammogram procedure, a radiographer will compress one of your breasts between two X-ray plates. This shouldn't be painful, but you should tell the radiographer if you find it uncomfortable.</p>
        
        <h2 class="content-subtitle">Ultrasound</h2>
        <p class="content-text">An ultrasound scan uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your breasts, in the same way an unborn baby can be seen in the womb.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">An ultrasound probe or sensor will be placed over your breasts to create an image of the inside of your breasts on a screen. The image will highlight any lumps or abnormalities that may be present in your breasts.</p>
        
        <h2 class="content-subtitle">Biopsy</h2>
        <p class="content-text">A biopsy may be recommended if a mammogram or ultrasound scan highlight any lumps or abnormalities in your breasts.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">A biopsy is a test that can either confirm or rule out a diagnosis of breast cancer in men. It involves taking a sample of suspected cancerous tissue and examining it in a laboratory for the presence of cancerous cells.</p>
        
        <h2 class="content-subtitle">Coping with a diagnosis</h2>
        <p class="content-text">Being told you have breast cancer can cause a wide range of emotions, such as shock, fear, confusion and, in some cases, embarrassment.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">Most people assume breast cancer only affects women, so it can be difficult to come to terms with the diagnosis.</p>
        
        <div class="info-box">
          <p><strong>Support:</strong> Feelings of isolation and being alone are common in men with breast cancer. There are support organizations available to help you through this difficult time.</p>

        <h1 class="content-title">Treating Breast Cancer in Men</h1>
        <p class="content-text">Treatment for breast cancer in men largely depends on how far the cancer has spread.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">Most hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) to treat men with breast cancer. These are teams of specialists who work together to make decisions about the best way to proceed with your treatment.</p>
        
        <h2 class="content-subtitle">Your treatment plan</h2>
        <p class="content-text">Your recommended treatment plan depends on how far the cancer has spread. If the cancer hasn't spread significantly beyond your breast, a complete cure may be possible.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">In these cases, surgery to remove the affected breast is usually recommended. This is often followed by radiotherapy, hormone therapy, or chemotherapy to help prevent the cancer returning.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">If the cancer has spread beyond your breast into other parts of your body, such as your lungs, a complete cure won't be possible. However, hormone therapy and chemotherapy can be used to relieve symptoms and slow down the spread of the cancer.</p>
        
        <h2 class="content-subtitle">Surgery</h2>
        <p class="content-text">An operation called a mastectomy is usually recommended as the first treatment for breast cancer.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">A mastectomy involves removing the entire breast, sometimes with the nipple and lymph nodes (glands) in the armpit.</p>
        
        <h2 class="content-subtitle">Radiotherapy</h2>
        <p class="content-text">Radiotherapy is a type of treatment involving a machine that releases high-energy waves to destroy cancerous cells. It can be given a few weeks after surgery to prevent the cancerous cells returning.</p>
        
        <h2 class="content-subtitle">Hormone therapy</h2>
        <p class="content-text">Up to 90% of cases of breast cancers in men are oestrogen receptor positive. This means the cancerous cells require oestrogen to grow.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">The aim of hormone therapy is to block the effects of oestrogen on the breast tissue to prevent the cancer recurring after surgery. It can also be used in cases of advanced breast cancer to slow down the spread of the cancer.</p>
        
        <h3 class="content-subtitle-small">Tamoxifen</h3>
        <p class="content-text">Tamoxifen is one of the hormone-blocking medications widely used for breast cancer. It prevents oestrogen entering the breast tissue cells.</p>
        
        <h2 class="content-subtitle">Chemotherapy</h2>
        <p class="content-text">Chemotherapy is used to treat cases of breast cancer where hormone therapy would be largely ineffective because the cancerous cells are not oestrogen receptor positive.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">It's usually given after surgery to help prevent the cancer returning, or it's used to treat the symptoms of incurable cancer.</p>
        
        <h2 class="content-subtitle">Biological therapy</h2>
        <p class="content-text">Biological therapy uses medication to block the effects of a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in cases where HER2 is contributing to breast cancer.</p>
        
        <div class="success-box">
          <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Your cancer team will recommend what they think is the ideal treatment option, but the final decision will be yours. Don't hesitate to ask questions about your treatment options.</p>
