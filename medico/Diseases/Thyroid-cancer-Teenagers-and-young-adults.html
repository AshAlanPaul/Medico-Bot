        <h1 class="content-title">Introduction</h1>
        <p class="content-text">This section is for teens and young adults. It's about a type of cancer called thyroid cancer.</p>

        <p class="content-text">If you're looking for information about thyroid cancer in people of all ages, read our thyroid cancer section.</p>

        <p class="content-text">Papillary and follicular thyroid cancers are the most common types of thyroid cancer in young adults. If you'd like to find out about a different type of thyroid cancer you could talk to Macmillan Cancer Support.</p>

        <p class="content-text">It's important to remember that thyroid cancer in young people can be successfully treated. Most young people are completely cured.</p>

        <h2 class="content-subtitle">Symptoms</h2>
        <p class="content-text">The first sign of thyroid cancer is usually a painless lump or swelling in the front of the neck that gradually gets bigger.</p>

        <p class="content-text">Less common symptoms are:</p>
        <ul class="content-list">
          <li>A hoarse voice that doesn't get better</li>
          <li>Difficulty swallowing or breathing</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="content-text">If you have any of these symptoms, it's important to speak to a doctor.</p>

        <p class="content-text">Remember – these symptoms can happen for lots of reasons other than cancer.</p>

        <h2 class="content-subtitle">What are the causes of thyroid cancer?</h2>
        <p class="content-text">It's unknown exactly what causes thyroid cancer. But research into possible causes is going on all the time. Some things called risk factors increase your chance of developing cancer. But having these doesn't mean you'll get cancer.</p>

        <h3 class="content-subtitle">Genes</h3>
        <p class="content-text">Genes are the biological information in each cell that we inherit from our parents. Genes affect the way we look (for example, our eye colour) and how our bodies grow and work. Some rare genetic conditions that run in families can increase the risk of thyroid cancer. But fewer than 1 in 10 cases of cancer are caused by an inherited faulty gene.</p>

        <h3 class="content-subtitle">Radiotherapy</h3>
        <p class="content-text">If you were exposed to radiation or had radiotherapy treatment to the neck area when you were younger, you may be at a higher risk of developing thyroid cancer many years later.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
          <p><strong>Important:</strong> If you think you might have some of these symptoms you should go straight to your GP. They'll be able to talk to you about your symptoms and arrange tests if necessary.</p>

        <h1 class="content-title">The Thyroid and Types of Thyroid Cancer</h1>

        <p class="content-text">The thyroid is a small gland in the front of the neck just below the voice box (larynx). It is made up of 2 parts, or lobes, 1 on each side of the neck. It's part of a network of glands throughout the body that make up the endocrine system. This system is responsible for producing the body's hormones that help to control and influence various body functions.</p>

        <p class="content-text">The thyroid produces 2 hormones:</p>
        <ul class="content-list">
          <li>Thyroid hormone that controls your metabolism</li>
          <li>Calcitonin that helps to control the calcium levels in your body</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="content-subtitle">Types of thyroid cancer</h2>
        <p class="content-text">There are 4 main types of thyroid cancer:</p>
        <ul class="content-list">
          <li><strong>Papillary</strong> is the most common type of thyroid cancer – it's usually slow-growing</li>
          <li><strong>Follicular</strong> is the second most common type – it's also usually slow-growing</li>
          <li><strong>Medullary</strong> is a rare type of thyroid cancer which sometimes runs in families</li>
          <li><strong>Anaplastic</strong> is another rare type of thyroid cancer, which is more common in older people</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="content-text">Young people are mostly affected by the papillary and follicular types.</p>

        <p class="content-text">Rarely other types of cancer occur in the thyroid gland such as lymphoma, or other cancers that have spread from another part of the body.</p>

        <div class="success-box">
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> This information is specifically tailored for teenagers and young adults with thyroid cancer.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div id="having-tests-for-thyroid-cancer" class="content-section">
        <h1 class="content-title">Having Tests for Thyroid Cancer</h1>

        <p class="content-text">This information is for teenagers and young adults who may be having tests to find out if they have thyroid cancer.</p>

        <p class="content-text">If you think you might have some of the symptoms of thyroid cancer, you should talk to your GP. If they think the symptoms could be because of cancer, they can do tests to find out more.</p>

        <h2 class="content-subtitle">Visiting your GP</h2>
        <p class="content-text">When you go to your GP they will usually examine you and arrange some blood tests. There may be a number of reasons why you have these symptoms. If your GP is concerned that you may have thyroid cancer they will make an appointment for you with a specialist at the hospital.</p>

        <h2 class="content-subtitle">At the hospital</h2>
        <p class="content-text">You'll probably be seen by lots of people at the hospital during and after the tests they do to find out what is happening to you. They work as a team and all have an important part in your care, even though you may only meet some of them.</p>

        <p class="content-text">They may include:</p>
        <ul class="content-list">
          <li>A doctor who specialises in thyroid problems (endocrinologist)</li>
          <li>A surgeon who specialises in thyroid surgery</li>
          <li>A pathologist who looks at blood and tissue samples to diagnose diseases</li>
          <li>A cancer specialist (oncologist)</li>
          <li>An X-ray specialist (radiologist)</li>
          <li>A clinical nurse specialist</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="content-text">Your doctor will examine you and arrange for more detailed tests, which may include an ultrasound, a fine needle aspiration (FNA) or a biopsy.</p>

        <p class="content-text">An FNA involves having a very small needle placed into your thyroid gland to remove a few cells for the pathologist to look at under the microscope.</p>

        <p class="content-text">A biopsy involves removing a small piece of the thyroid to be analysed. You might have a general anaesthetic and so will be asleep when it is done. You may only need a local anaesthetic, which numbs the area.</p>

        <div class="warning-box">
          <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Having tests and waiting for the results can be an anxious time. Talking about how you feel and getting support from your family, friends, specialist nurse or doctor can help.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div id="treating-thyroid-cancer" class="content-section">
        <h1 class="content-title">Treating Thyroid Cancer</h1>

        <p class="content-text">It's important to remember that thyroid cancer in young people can be successfully treated. Most young people are completely cured. If the tests you've had show you have thyroid cancer, your team of specialists will discuss treatment with you.</p>

        <h2 class="content-subtitle">Surgery</h2>
        <p class="content-text">Surgery to remove the thyroid gland is the main treatment for thyroid cancer. You might hear the doctors talk about a thyroidectomy, which is the medical name for the operation. Sometimes the surgeon will only need to remove part of your thyroid.</p>

        <h3 class="content-subtitle">Lymph nodes</h3>
        <p class="content-text">In the neck, close to the thyroid, there are lymph nodes. These are part of the body's immune system and help fight infection. Sometimes cancer cells settle in these lymph nodes, so the surgeon might remove some or all of the nodes as well. They may also remove some tissue from the area around the thyroid if they suspect that there are any cancer cells there.</p>

        <h3 class="content-subtitle">After the operation</h3>
        <p class="content-text">You will probably need to spend a few days in hospital after the operation. There will be a scar on your neck – usually just above the collarbone. Sometimes you can have a low calcium level in your blood or a hoarse voice after the operation. You may need to take tablets to replace the thyroid hormone.</p>

        <h2 class="content-subtitle">Radioactive iodine</h2>
        <p class="content-text">If you've been told that you need to have treatment with radioactive iodine, you may be worried about what's going to happen. Knowing what to expect can help.</p>

        <h3 class="content-subtitle">How does it work?</h3>
        <p class="content-text">There's a mineral called iodine in the bloodstream. Normal thyroid tissue takes iodine from the bloodstream and uses it to make thyroid hormones. Some thyroid cancers can take iodine from the bloodstream too.</p>

        <p class="content-text">Radioactive iodine is often used after surgery when the whole thyroid gland has been removed. Any thyroid cancer cells left behind soak up the iodine which contains high doses of radiation. This helps to destroy them.</p>

        <h2 class="content-subtitle">Hormone therapy after treatment for thyroid cancer</h2>
        <p class="content-text">If you've had all your thyroid gland removed, your body can't produce thyroid hormones anymore. Without these hormones, your metabolism slows down. This can cause dry skin and hair, tiredness, poor concentration and lack of energy.</p>

        <h3 class="content-subtitle">What can help?</h3>
        <p class="content-text">These hormones can be replaced by taking tablets. You'll need to take them for the rest of your life. The usual long-term hormone treatment is thyroxine (levothyroxine) and you normally start taking it once your radioactive iodine treatment is finished.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
          <p><strong>Important:</strong> It's important to remember to take your tablets every day. It can help to take them at the same time every day so you get into a routine.</p>
