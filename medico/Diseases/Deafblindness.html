        <h1 class="content-title">About deafblindness</h1>
        <p class="content-text">Deafblindness is a combination of sight and hearing loss that affects a person's ability to communicate, access information and get around.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">It's also sometimes called 'dual sensory loss' or 'multi-sensory impairment'.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">A deafblind person won't usually be totally deaf and totally blind, but both senses will be reduced enough to cause significant difficulties in everyday life.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">These problems can occur even if hearing loss and vision loss are mild, as the 2 senses work together and 1 would usually help compensate for loss of the other.</p>
        
        <h2 class="content-subtitle">Signs of deafblindness</h2>
        <p class="content-text">Deafblindness most commonly affects older adults, although it can affect people of all ages, including babies and young children.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">In older people, it may develop gradually and the person themselves may not realise their vision and/or hearing is getting worse at first.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">Signs of a problem can include:</p>
        <ul class="content-list">
          <li>needing to turn up the volume on the television or radio</li>
          <li>difficulty following a conversation</li>
          <li>not hearing noises such as a knock at the door</li>
          <li>asking others to speak loudly, slowly and more clearly</li>
          <li>needing to hold books or newspapers very close, or sitting close to the television</li>
          <li>difficulty moving around unfamiliar places</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="info-box">
          <p><strong>Medical advice:</strong> If someone already has either a hearing or vision problem, it's important to look out for signs that suggest the other sense may be getting worse too.</p>

        <h1 class="content-title">Causes of deafblindness</h1>
        <p class="content-text">There are many possible causes of deafblindness. The condition can either be present at birth or develop later in life.</p>
        
        <h2 class="content-subtitle">Deafblindness from birth</h2>
        <p class="content-text">Deafblindness from birth is known as congenital deafblindness.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">It can be caused by:</p>
        <ul class="content-list">
          <li>problems associated with premature birth (birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy)</li>
          <li>an infection picked up during pregnancy, such as rubella (German measles), toxoplasmosis or cytomegalovirus (CMV)</li>
          <li>genetic conditions, such as CHARGE syndrome or Down's syndrome</li>
          <li>cerebral palsy - a problem with the brain and nervous system that mainly affects movement and co-ordination</li>
          <li>foetal alcohol syndrome - health problems caused by drinking alcohol in pregnancy</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="content-subtitle">Deafblindness later in life</h2>
        <p class="content-text">In most cases, deafblindness develops later in life. This is known as acquired deafblindness.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">A person with acquired deafblindness may be born without a hearing or sight problem and then later loses part or all of both senses. Alternatively, someone may be born with either a hearing or vision problem, and then later loses part or all of the other sense later on.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">Problems that can contribute to acquired deafblindness include:</p>
        <ul class="content-list">
          <li>age-related hearing loss</li>
          <li>Usher syndrome - a genetic condition that affects hearing, vision and balance</li>
          <li>eye problems associated with increasing age, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), cataracts and glaucoma</li>
          <li>diabetic retinopathy - a complication of diabetes where the cells lining the back of the eye are damaged by high blood sugar levels</li>
          <li>damage to the brain, such as from meningitis, encephalitis, a stroke or severe head injury</li>
        </ul>

      <div id="diagnosing-deafblindness" class="content-section">
        <h1 class="content-title">Diagnosing deafblindness</h1>
        <p class="content-text">Deafblindness may be detected soon after a baby is born, or after tests carried out later in life.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">Speak to your GP if you have any concerns about your or your child's hearing and/or vision at any point.</p>
        
        <h2 class="content-subtitle">Newborn screening</h2>
        <p class="content-text">If your baby is born deafblind, this will usually be picked up during newborn screening.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">These are a series of checks carried out to see if your baby has any serious health problems from birth, including any problems with their eyes or hearing.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">If no problems are picked up at this stage, they may be detected during routine checks as your child gets older.</p>
        
        <h2 class="content-subtitle">Hearing and vision tests for adults</h2>
        <p class="content-text">In most cases, deafblindness develops as a person gets older. It can happen gradually, so you may not notice that your vision and/or hearing are getting worse at first.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">It's therefore important to have routine eye tests to check for any problems. Adults should normally have their eyes tested every two years.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">You can request a hearing test at your GP surgery at any point if you think you may be losing your hearing.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">A person may be diagnosed with deafblindness if tests show they have both hearing and vision problems.</p>
        
        <h2 class="content-subtitle">Specialist assessment</h2>
        <p class="content-text">As soon as deafblindness has been identified, a specialist assessment should be arranged by the local authority.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">The assessment should only be carried out by a specially trained professional who is able to identify the deafblind person's abilities and needs.</p>
        
        <div class="success-box">
          <p><strong>Assessment includes:</strong> communication, one-to-one human contact, social interaction, emotional wellbeing, support with mobility, assistive technology, and rehabilitation.</p>

        <h1 class="content-title">Managing deafblindness</h1>
        <p class="content-text">It's not always possible to treat the underlying causes of deafblindness, but a range of care and support services is available to help people with the condition.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">Most deafblind people will still have some hearing and/or vision. The level of care and support they need will depend on how severe their hearing and vision problems are.</p>
        
        <h2 class="content-subtitle">Individual care plan</h2>
        <p class="content-text">The individual abilities and needs of a deafblind person should be assessed soon after they're diagnosed. This will allow a tailored care plan to be drawn up.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">The care plan will aim to:</p>
        <ul class="content-list">
          <li>preserve and maximise any remaining sensory functions the person has</li>
          <li>teach alternative communication methods such as the deafblind manual alphabet</li>
          <li>help the person retain as much independence as possible - for example, by recommending they receive training to use a long cane or guide dog</li>
          <li>for young children, ensure their educational needs are met</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="content-subtitle">Communication systems</h2>
        <p class="content-text">As deafblindness can make communicating by speech and writing difficult, alternative forms of communication may be necessary.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">The main communication systems used by deafblind people include:</p>
        <ul class="content-list">
          <li>clear speech - speaking clearly is one of the most effective and common ways of communicating</li>
          <li>deafblind manual alphabet - a tactile form of communication where words are spelt onto the deafblind person's hand</li>
          <li>block alphabet - a simple tactile form of communication where a word is spelt out in capital letters</li>
          <li>hands-on signing - an adapted version of British Sign Language (BSL)</li>
          <li>braille - a system that uses a series of raised dots to represent letters</li>
          <li>moon - similar to Braille, but uses raised, adapted capital letters</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="info-box">
          <p><strong>Support:</strong> Every deafblind person is entitled to help from a specially trained one-to-one support worker if they need it.</p>
